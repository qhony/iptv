# IPTV_analysis

#### Description
This project collects open-source IPTV source files or possibly valid links, and converts them into channels recognizable by the Synology IPTV Management System, outputting to a new M3U file.

#### Software Architecture
The software runs in a Python 3 environment. The personal version used in Python 3.11.4. If there are any issues with running the program, please refer to the changes in the relevant version.

#### Installation

1.  Install the Python 3.11 runtime environment.
2.  The code execution requires libraries such as `requests`, `random`, `time`, `re`. Therefore, before running the program, execute the following command to install the libraries: `pip install requests`.

#### Instructions

1.  Prepare the  `ipty.py` file and the original M3U file in the current directory where the code is stored.
2.  Run directly: `python ipty.py`.
3.  If the program runs for a long time without further execution, please close it and collect the generated M3U file in the current directory.

#### Contribution

1.  None.
